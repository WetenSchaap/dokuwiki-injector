**Usage**

Before you can use this extension, you need to configure your Dokuwiki instance (or ask your admin to do it for you): in the configuration settings, under `Authentication`: first enable `remote`, and second `remoteuser` needs to set to either your username (say `wetenschaap`) or the user group you want to use (like `@user`).

When you've done that, you need to configure the extension. Either open the extension options in the browser extension manager or follow the link in the new Dokuwiki injector box on your search engine. There, you just need to set your Dokuwiki address and a Dokuwiki auth token.

To get a Dokuwiki auth token, go to *Update Profile* in Dokuwiki, and copy the token given there, see below.

Once the extension is properly configured Dokuwiki search results will show in the right sidebar. If there are no search results nothing will appear.
